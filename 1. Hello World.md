# Python Flask - Creating a simple _'Hello World'_ webpage 🌐

Today, we’ll learn how to create a simple webpage using **Flask**.



## What We’re Going to Do: 📚
1. **Install Flask**: Set up the Flask framework.
2. **Write the Code**: Create a Python program that uses Flask.
3. **Run the Web Server**: Start Flask and view your webpage in a browser.
4. **Understand the Code**: Break down what each part of the code does.

## Step 1: Install Flask 🛠️

Before we can use Flask, we need to install it. 

Open `Thonny` then go to **Tools -> Open system shell...** and type:

```bash
pip install flask
```

This command tells Python’s package manager to install Flask. Once it’s done, we’re ready to write our code.

---

## Step 2: Writing the Code 🧑🏽‍💻

Create a new file called `app.py`. This file will contain the code for our Flask application.

Here’s the code:

```python
# Import the Flask framework
from flask import Flask  

# Create a new Flask application
app = Flask(__name__)  

@app.route('/')  # Define a route for the homepage
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'  # Display "Hello, World!" on the webpage

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)  # Run the web server
```

Save the file and let’s move to the next step.

## Step 3: Launch the Web Server 🚀

1. Run your program in `Thonny`.
2. You should see output like this:

```
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Debugger is active!
```

3. Click the link to open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

Congratulations! You should see **"Hello, World!"** displayed on the webpage.

### 🚨Troubleshoot 🚨

    <summary>👀 Help Here </summary>


Flask not working in Thonny on the default port (`5000`) is likely due to how Thonny manages its internal processes and handles networking.

Here’s an explanation:

---

### Why `http://127.0.0.1:5000` Might Not Work in Thonny
1. **Thonny’s Built-in Debugger**:  
   Thonny uses its own debugger and process manager, which can interfere with Flask's default behavior on port `5000`. Specifically:
   - Flask's default debug mode (`debug=True`) starts a secondary thread for the debugger, and Thonny's environment might block or conflict with this behavior.
   - Flask might start running but not serve requests properly due to these conflicts.

2. **Port Conflict**:  
   The default Flask port (`5000`) might already be in use by another application, or Thonny itself might be restricting access to this port. This prevents the server from binding to the port successfully.

3. **Networking in Thonny**:  
   Thonny’s sandboxed execution environment might limit how it handles network requests or prevent Flask from responding on the expected localhost (`127.0.0.1`) interface.

---

### 🤓 Try this Custom Code:
```python
app.run(host='127.0.0.1', port=6006, debug=False)
```
Here’s why specifying the `host`, `port`, and disabling debug mode resolves the issue:

1. **Setting the `host`**:  
   Specifying `host='127.0.0.1'` explicitly ensures Flask binds to the local machine's network interface. This is the default, but Thonny might require explicit instructions to avoid ambiguities.

2. **Changing the Port**:  
   Setting `port=6006` ensures Flask uses a port that is unlikely to conflict with other services. Ports in the 6000+ range are less commonly used by default services, reducing the chance of conflicts.

3. **Disabling Debug Mode**:  
   Disabling `debug` mode (`debug=False`) prevents Flask from starting its built-in debugger, which uses a separate thread and can conflict with Thonny's process management. Without the debugger, Flask runs in a single-threaded mode, which Thonny handles more predictably.

---

### 💡 How to Solve Similar Issues
1. **Use a Different Port**:  
   If port `5000` doesn't work, choose another port (e.g., `6006` or `8080`) to ensure no conflicts.

2. **Run Flask Outside of Thonny**:  
   For fewer limitations, run your Flask app in a terminal or command prompt outside Thonny. This bypasses Thonny’s restrictions entirely.

3. **Upgrade Thonny**:  
   Ensure you're using the latest version of Thonny, as newer versions may have better Flask support.

4. **Check for Port Conflicts**:  
   Use a tool to check if port `5000` is already in use:
   - On Windows: `netstat -ano | findstr :5000`
   - On macOS/Linux: `lsof -i :5000`

## Step 4: Understanding the Code 🔍

Let’s break down what each part of the code does:

### 1. **Importing Flask** 📦
```python
from flask import Flask
```
This line brings the Flask framework into your program so you can use its tools to create web applications.

### 2. **Creating the Flask App** 🏗️
```python
app = Flask(__name__)
```
This line creates a new Flask application. Think of it as setting up the main workspace for your web app.

💡**Note:** these are double underscores before and after name -> `__name__`

### 3. **Defining a Route** 🌐
```python
@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
```
- `@app.route('/')` defines a **route**.
    - A route is a URL path that your application listens to. The `/` route represents the homepage.
- `def hello_world():` defines a function that runs when someone visits the route.
    - In this case, it shows "Hello, World!".

### 4. **Returning Content** 🖥️
```python
return 'Hello, World!'
```
This tells Flask what to display when someone visits the route. It’s like saying, _"Hey, show this text on the webpage."_

### 5. **Running the App** ⚙️
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
- `if __name__ == '__main__':` ensures that the app runs only if the file is executed directly (and not imported).
- `app.run(debug=True)` starts the web server and activates the **debug mode**, which helps you find errors easily.

---

## Challenges ⚔️
1. Change the `return` statement to display your name instead of "Hello, World!".
   - Example: `return 'Hello, [Your Name]!'`
2. Add another route, like `/about`, that displays a short description about yourself.
3. Create a new route called `/greet` that takes a name as a parameter and displays a personalized message. 
   - Example: Visiting `/greet?name=Alex` should display "Hello, Alex!".

## Summary 📝

In this lesson, you:
- Learned how to install Flask.
- Created a simple Flask app to display _"Hello, World!"_.
- Understood (hopefully) how the code works.

This is just the beginning of web development with Flask. With practice, you’ll be able to create amazing websites and applications. Keep experimenting and have fun coding!
